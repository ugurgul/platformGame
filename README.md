There is a map in which we have 1 character and a few enemies.
When our character dies, it scatters blood effect.
It can also shoot at enemies.
There are health bars on our character and enemies.
When our character hits the enemies, it loses 10 lives and this appears on the screen with the help of a nice effect.
At the same time, there are "Home", "Play", "RePlay" buttons in our game.
There is an asset that I have already used in the game. You can improve your game by adding environmental elements as you wish.
